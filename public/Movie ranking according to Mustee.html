<h2>My best 5 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Vampire Diaries</h3>
<p>This is my number favorite movie of all time. its packed with actionand so much thriller. You'll come tell me so much about how you love Stefan's charms</p>

<h3>The Originals</h3>
<p>This is actually the second because its a sequel from the vampire diaries. Oh how i've missed the tyrany of Klaus Mikaelson</p>

<h3>Game of thrones</h3>
<p>Who wouldn't love this movie? From the first episode down to the last, everything about it is just so perfect. Arya stark, Sansa stark, Jon snow and all.</p>

<h3>Teenwolf</h3>
<p>One of the best thriller movies i've seen in recent years</p>

<h3>24</h3>
<p>Movie filled with action,suspence and so much curiosity. you just can't trust anyone. Jack Bauer was so good at this role</p>
